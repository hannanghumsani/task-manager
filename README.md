# üé´ TicketCRM: Modern Support Ticket Management System

**TicketCRM** is a single-page application (SPA) designed to manage customer support tickets efficiently. It simulates a simple CRM dashboard, allowing users to create, view, filter, sort, and update ticket statuses and priorities. All data persistence is handled locally using the browser's `localStorage` API, acting as a mock backend for a seamless and responsive user experience.
